# jbrute.sh

## ABOUT
When you use an online login page, a request gets sent with your username and password get passed to the server before it is hashed and stored/checked for authentication. This tool sends those requests automatically with the ability to use dictionary attacks and proxychains4 to avoid lockouts. The J in JBrute stands for JSON. For the '-b' option, you can use any request body that is needed for your target so long as it is expecting a JSON type request. If you do not know what the body request looks like, you can use the Network tab of the Developer Console in your Browser to analyze the POST requests (right click and select 'Edit and Resend'). FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. DONT BE EVIL. ONLY USE ON SYSTEMS YOU HAVE PERMISSION FROM
